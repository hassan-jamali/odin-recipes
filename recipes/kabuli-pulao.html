    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Afghan rice dice called kabuli pulao is made in a pressure cooker. The perfectly textured rice is infused with flavor from a seasoned homemade broth. You can also prepare it on your stovetop.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups sella basmati rice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup matchstick carrots</li>
        <li>1/2 cup raisins</li>
        <li>1/2 cup slivered almonds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cardamom pod, shell removed and seeds crushed into a powder</li>
        <li>1 whole clove</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the broth: Place halved onion, garlic head, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, pepper, cumin seed, salt, sugar, paprika, coriander seeds, and cloves into a pressure cooker. Pour in water to cover. </li>
        <li>Close the cooker securely and place the pressure regulator over the vent according to manufacturer's instructions. Set to high and heat until steam escapes in a steady flow and makes a whistling sound, about 5 minutes. Reduce to medium and cook for 20 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally, about 10 minutes. Unlock the lid and remove. </li>
        <li>When the broth is almost finished, start the rice: Soak rice in cool water for 5 minutes, then rinse until water runs clear. </li>
        <li>Strain cooled broth into a bowl. Clean out the pressure cooker, then place over medium heat and add oil. </li>
        <li>Add onion and garlic to the cooker; cook and stir until softened and browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir in carrots and cook until soft, about 3 minutes more. Add strained rice, raisins, almonds, cumin seed, pepper, cardamom powder, and clove. Stir to combine, then pour in enough broth to cover. </li>
        <li>Close the cooker securely and seal the vent; set to high and heat until the first whistle, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce to medium and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let rest for 7 minutes, then let pressure release naturally, about 10 minutes. Immediately transfer cooked rice to a serving dish to prevent overcooking. </li>
        <li>Boil broth ingredients for 1 hour. After soaking the rice, combine all rice ingredients and all broth (if broth doesn't measure 3 1/2 cups, add water to get that amount of liquid) and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and place a paper towel over the pot. Cover with a lid and cook until rice is tender, about 25 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
